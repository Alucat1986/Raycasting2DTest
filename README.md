# Raycasting tests in a 2D Enviremont
A little repository where i try out stuff with Raycasting in 2D using C++ and SFML

The program itself is inspired by the online lecture from Dave Churchill. In his course he showed
a little app that showcased how raycasting looks to show how to show lights and shadows.
